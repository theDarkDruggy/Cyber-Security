# **Network Fundamentals**  

**Open System :** A system that is able to connect with other systems.  
**Closed System :** A system that is not able to connect with other systems.
**Computer Networks :** An interconnection between multiple systems and multiple devices.  
**Network Topology :** Shape of how network devices connecting.  
**OSI**( *open Systems interconnection* ) : That defines protocols for communication and connection.  
**Host Name :** Uniqe name of the device in the Network.  
**Ip address :** Ip address is address of the every device in the network. *private ip address* is used to connect with other devices in the network. *public ip address* is used to connect with devices out of the network. You can get ip addresses while writing ifconfig/ipconfig to command line.  
**MAC**( *Media Access Control* ) : A media access control address (MAC address) is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for use as a network address in communications within a network segment.  
**Port :** A port can be referred to as a logical channel through which data can be sent/received to an application.  
* 0-1023 : Well-known ports
* 1024-49151 : Registered ports
* 19152-65535 : Ephemeral ports  

You can write **netstat -a** to command line.  
**Socket :** A unique combination of port number and ip number , those are termed together as Socket.  
**DNS Server :** DNS (Domain  Name System) is a system that converts urls to ip address and provides access.
